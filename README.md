# Cryptography
Cryptography Project - Encoding and Decoding System
This project implements a basic cryptographic system using C++. It features both encoding (encryption) and decoding (decryption) functionality, with a focus on secure data transmission.

Key Features:
Symmetric Encryption: Uses a common key for both encoding and decoding operations, providing fast and reliable data encryption.
Cross-Platform: Developed in C++ to ensure compatibility across various operating systems.
Efficient Processing: Optimized for speed and performance, capable of handling large datasets with minimal resource consumption.
Error Handling: Ensures data integrity by validating inputs before encryption and decryption
